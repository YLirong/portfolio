<h2>Me</h2>
  <p class="center">
      I am Yanrong Li. An undergraduate majoring in Digital Media Art at SJSU. Currently, most of my works are using Photoshop to create digital images, and using basic coding technology in my design, and to meet the project requirement in the courses of the major. My works present my imagination, and things I have experienced in life, I express my thoughts and present them in the digital art form in fairy style, or abstract manner. My inspiration is a small seed deeply implanted in my heart from the fairy tales, and fable stories I read in my childhood. The story tells about life lessons in simple language. But it doesn't feel heavy. The story uses animals as the protagonist to describe the story metaphorically. The author is very creative in identifying the characteristics of animals and present stories that implicitly reflect humans. The illustrations in the story are cute with bright colors.<p>
<p class="center">
  Therefore, I apply these elements to my work in my Hyperreal Pandaâ€™s Residence series. I consider the things I encountered in life. I use panda represents me. And apply my imagination to create the dreamy story world to share with my audiences through visual and emotional effects. Besides, I also create some code art that I experience new ways to make art from traditional art tools.  I like to continue my panda series, as I exploring more technologies in DMA major, I want to build them in 3D form.
