      <h3>“Early Internet Memory”, HTML & CSS Website, 2019</h3>

      <p>This is a project in Art 75. I chose the two most impressing activities I used to play on my computer in my childhood. I rebuild my early internet memory with the most representative elements of the two.

        <h3>“Snowing”, Code Art using Processing, 2019</h3>
        <p>I live in an area that has never snowed. I am looking forward to snow, but I am afraid of the cold. I created this to satisfy my imagination of snow. And I simulated a scene from ugly duckling fairy tale, the ugly duckling in the story has appeared in the cold winter, so I added this figure. </p>

<h3>“Ink Painting”, Code Art using Processing, 2019</h3>
<p>My idea is to paint on a unique canvas. I made my own brush with programming. I express my understanding of action painting.</p>

            <h3>“TV Radio”,  Code Art using Processing, 2019</h3>
<p>
  My idea is to make a simulated weather forecast on TV. The news broadcast weather I saw on TV. The reported place paused for some time. Then switch to another place to introduce.

<h3> "O'Eye”, Code Art using P5.js, 2019</h3>
<p>This is a digital clock. My idea is that people see the change of time with their eyes. I put the two in one, the eye reflects the clock, and the clock shows the eye.
